# solidity-smart-contract

**INTRODUCTION. 

**Ethereum is a decentralized platform designed to execute randomly programmed smart contracts. The Ethereum project is open source and has a fairly large community (developers, testers, smart contract developers, users). Ethereum implements a distributed database for storing and synchronizing data on the status of user accounts and smart contract accounts, and the base currency of the platform (cryptocurrency) ether. 

**A smart contract is a digital agreement to redistribute value between counterparties which implies a strict and unambiguous setting of conditions, automating execution processes and minimizing the involvement of trusted parties. This is most often achieved by combining rigorous mechanisms for creating and validating conditions based on the characteristics of the Ethereum platform.

**A system running such a protocol is called a smart contracts platform, where contracts are placed in special transactions (or requests), which must be signed by all parties involved in the transaction. After such a transaction is confirmed on the smart contract platform, it becomes impossible to change the terms of the contract, violate or cancel their execution.

**OBJECTIVE:

**Is to acquire skills in writing smart contracts in the Solidity programming language and deploying them in the Ethereum test network.

**Here, the bank comtract aims at :

**Adding New Payment to the bank, Collecting the payment information and finally getting data of all payments made.

**GETTING STARTED:

** 1.To test and run this project, you are required to install metamask wallet as a chrome browser extension and secure Eth token to it using Ropsten testnet.

** 2."copy raw content" of the BankTransaction.sol file in the master branch of the repository.

** 3.Paste the content in REMIX IDE and save as a file.

** 4.Compile the source code to fix errors if available.

** 5.Deploy to the network.
**
**BUILT USING: Solidity programming language. ** Remix IDE.

**BRANCHES IN USE:

Master branch:
